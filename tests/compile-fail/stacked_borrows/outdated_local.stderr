   = help: this indicates a potential bug in the program: it performed an invalid operation, but the rules it violated are still experimental
   = help: see https://github.com/rust-lang/unsafe-code-guidelines/blob/master/wip/stacked-borrows.md for further information
help: tag was most recently created at offsets [$HEX..$HEX]

help: tag was later invalidated at offsets [$HEX..$HEX]

LL |     x = 1; // this invalidates y by reactivating the lowermost uniq borrow for this local
