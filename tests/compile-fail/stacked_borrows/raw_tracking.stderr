   = help: this indicates a potential bug in the program: it performed an invalid operation, but the rules it violated are still experimental
   = help: see https://github.com/rust-lang/unsafe-code-guidelines/blob/master/wip/stacked-borrows.md for further information
help: <BORROW_IDX> was created by a retag at offsets [0x0..0x4]

help: <BORROW_IDX> was later invalidated at offsets [0x0..0x4]
